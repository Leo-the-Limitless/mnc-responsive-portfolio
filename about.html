          It was during the pandemic, and I've just finished my Matriculation Exam. There was this basic C programming
          class hosted by <a>Start Smart</a>, a youth organization in
          Myanmar. As I've always wanted to try out coding, I joined that class, and
          found myself enjoying it a lot. It was my very first step of this exciting journey,
          and below are some important milestones along the way.
